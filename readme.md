# Prescription Bot

### This is a bot I use to quickly order my repeat prescriptions from my local GP website.

To run this program chrome webdriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads is needed.
Then we need to extract the file and move it to a location that is easy to access, and paste that location in the PATH variable in the program.

selenium is also required: $pip install selenium
